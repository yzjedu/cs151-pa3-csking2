I was supposed to learn how ASCII art works and how to program it so it shows the user
an image. I first thought of how I would even go about making simple shapes, then I proceeded to
think of different images that were challenging enough but not to the point where I was struggling to
code them. The key concepts explored were using pretty much everything we have already learned, functions, while loops,
if else statements. My results do match what I expected to get, the program works even with user error.
The biggest challenge I encountered was programming the random images. I first designed my program, then wrote it
then I tested it and added what needed to be added to make it function properly.
I think I learned what I was supposed to because I figured out what ASCII art is and 
how to program it. It was hard working by myself and probably took longer than it should've, but I'm very
confident in the new skills I've learned.
